## Provider and model-maker logos

The SVG logos of the AI providers and model makers shown in the model picker,
the chat composer and the usage screens come from
**[lobe-icons](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-icons)**, MIT licensed.

They are normalized into the Obsidian icon space by `scripts/genLogos.mjs` and
**shipped inlined in `main.js`** — the `assets/svg/` folder is not distributed,
but its content is. This notice travels with the plugin for that reason.

### Trademarks

The logos are trademarks of their respective owners — OpenAI, Anthropic,
Google, NVIDIA, Ollama, OpenRouter, Meta, DeepSeek, Mistral AI, Alibaba
(Qwen), Z.ai, ByteDance, Black Forest Labs and Stability AI.

They are used here **only to identify which provider or model maker a given
model belongs to**, so a list of model names is scannable by eye. No
affiliation, sponsorship or endorsement is claimed or implied, and none of
these companies is involved with this plugin.

## Model popularity baseline

`src/providers/hotData.generated.ts` holds a popularity baseline regenerated
weekly by `scripts/collect-hot.mjs` from public **Hugging Face** download
counts for open models, plus a hand-curated figure for closed ones. It is
plain numeric data, computed locally, and no telemetry of any kind is sent
from the plugin.

## Icons

The rest of the interface uses **Lucide** icons through Obsidian's own
`setIcon()` API. They ship with Obsidian, not with this plugin.
